Task3
📊 Customer Segmentation using KMeans & PCA
🔖 Internship Task 3 – MAINFLOW (Data Analysis)
This project is part of my data science internship at MAINFLOW, where I explored unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their financial behaviors using clustering and dimensionality reduction.

🚀 Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing analytics. This notebook applies KMeans clustering on financial data to categorize customers into distinct groups. The analysis also leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and better visualization of high-dimensional data.

🧰 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn & Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
📂 Workflow
Importing Libraries
Loading and Exploring Data
Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
Finding Optimal Clusters using the Elbow Method
Applying KMeans Clustering
Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
Visualizing Clusters and PCA Outputs
📈 Results
Identified optimal number of customer segments using the Elbow Method.
Successfully clustered customers using KMeans.
Reduced dimensionality and visualized clusters with PCA and pair plots.
📎 Files Included
